# Exploring How Instagram Screen Time Affects My Personal Productivity

## Motivation

In these days, social media platforms such as Instagram are now essential components of our everyday routines. Although there are numerous benefits, there is a growing worry about the potential negative effects of excessive screen time on productivity and general wellness. This project seeks to explore the impact of my Instagram usage on different areas of my life like sleep patterns, reading routines, exercise levels, and academic performance. I aim to analyze these connections in order to obtain valuable knowledge that will assist me in making educated choices to enhance both my productivity and health.

## Data Source

To ensure a comprehensive analysis, Iâ€™m collecting data from several sources. My Instagram screen time is tracked using the Screen Time feature on my iPhone, which logs daily app usage. Sleep patterns and daily physical activities are monitored via my Apple Watch, providing detailed insights into sleep quality and activity levels. Additionally, I manually record my studying and reading times in JSON format, documenting the duration spent on these activities each day.

## Data Analysis

The examination will advance through various important steps in order to guarantee precise and significant outcomes. Initially, I will gather and prepare data from my iPhone, Apple Watch, and written records, ensuring uniform formatting for consistency. Data cleaning involves dealing with missing values and inconsistencies to preserve the integrity of the data. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), I will create visual representations of the data in order to discern connections and patterns between time spent on Instagram and various other activities. Statistical techniques will be used to evaluate the magnitude and importance of any correlations identified. In conclusion, I will analyze the findings in relation to my original theory that more screen time has a detrimental impact on productivity and overall health.

## Findings

This section will be completed after the data analysis phase is finished, where I will detail the insights and conclusions drawn from the study.

## Data Limitations 

Recognizing various constraints of this research is crucial. Because the study relies on individual data, the results may not be applicable to a broader group. Data that is recorded by hand, such as recording study and reading durations, could potentially be influenced by biases or inaccuracies. Furthermore, this analysis does not consider external factors like stress levels or workload that could impact productivity.

## Future Plans

In the future, I intend to broaden the project by including more metrics such as mood assessments or dietary habits for a more comprehensive view of well-being. Prolonging the data collection period for a longitudinal study may provide more reliable insights. Furthermore, testing out various intervention tactics, like decreasing screen time and examining how they impact productivity, may be beneficial for future studies.

## Project Plan

The project will start by gathering data and establishing the project repository. Afterwards, my attention will be on scrubbing the data and conducting an initial analysis to get acquainted with the dataset. The main focus of the project is to carry out a thorough statistical examination and generate visual representations to demonstrate the results. Once the analysis is finished, I will consolidate the findings and create a detailed report outlining the approach and findings. The last step is to revise the report according to feedback and get ready for the project's presentation.
